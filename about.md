Hi, my name is __David Ensinger__ and I’m a __Front End Developer__ with equal parts interest in design, development, and writing.

I develop websites that are well designed, useable, and adhere to modern standards and accessibility requirements. I’m also no slouch at writing documentation, leading training, and providing ongoing support. My clients and co-workers will vouch that I play well with others too.

I’m currently employed by [CITYTECH, Inc](http://www.citytechinc.com/), a global IT consultancy. Previously I worked for [The Ohio State University Libraries](http://library.osu.edu/). In a past life I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Republic of Moldova. I graduated from the Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business with a B.S. in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance.

I am interested in the liberal arts, finance and investing, and staying physically fit and eating well. I also really enjoy living in Columbus, Ohio.

For my personal web presence, see the [Republic of the Spirit](http://www.republicofthespirit.com/).

## Contact

If you have any questions, comments, or would just like to say hello, please don't hesitate to [drop me a line](mailto:hello@davidensinger.com). I’ll be sure to respond in a timely manner!

## Colophon

This website was made on a [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/), designed in browser with [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), and marked up in [Haml](http://haml.info/) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Type is set in [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans), which is served by [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). Posts are composed in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and syntax is highlighted with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

The site is published with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) ([view the code](https://github.com/davidensinger/davidensinger.github.io)), while the code was compiled and committed into version control by [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/), respectively. [Consular](https://github.com/achiu/consular) was used to automate development workflow setup.

A number of supporting plugins and code snippets for Jekyll are used with the site:

- [Jekyll Templates for Atom, RSS](http://davecoyle.com/tech-notes/jekyll-templates-for-atom-rss/) by [Dave Coyle](http://davecoyle.com/)
- [Open Graph for Jekyll](https://gist.github.com/pathawks/1406355) by [Pat Hawks](http://alt.pathawks.com/)
- [Paginate Like a Boss](http://schmidt-happens.com/articles/2012/01/11/setup-pagination-for-jekyll-driven-sites.html) by [Terry Schmidt](http://schmidt-happens.com/)
- [Jekyll: Category and Tag Paging and Feeds](http://realjenius.com/2012/12/01/jekyll-category-tag-paging-feeds/) by [R.J. Lorimer](http://realjenius.com/)
- [sitemap.xml](https://github.com/havvg/havvg.github.com/blob/master/sitemap.xml) by [Toni Uebernickel](http://toni.uebernickel.info/)

A couple Sass mixins proved integral to the scaffolding of the site:

- [Breakpoint mixin](http://css-tricks.com/media-queries-sass-3-2-and-codekit/) by [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/)
- [Rem mixin](https://gist.github.com/webgefrickel/4530526) by [Steffen Becker](http://webgefrickel.de/)

In addition, I consulted the following resources for both inspiration and best practices:

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [Microformats Wiki](http://microformats.org/wiki/)
